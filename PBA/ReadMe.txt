This program contains the source code for the article "Numerical test of the PBA periodogram and Period analysis of FRB 20190520B," and is divided into three parts.

The first folder, "Calculate the FAP distribution," contains a program that calculates the FAP distribution under the observation windows (the observation window for FRB 20190520B and simulation experiments with observation windows of 5, 10, 20, and 40 days). In the absence of periodic burst data, the PBA periodogram was applied to search for periodicity 10,000 times, and the FAP obtained in each search was recorded. The program is divided into 20 processes, each responsible for 500 iterations, resulting in 20 .npy files, with each file containing 500 periodogram search results.

The second folder, "Simulation experiment," contains the simulation experiment program, which is used to compute the PBA search results for different simulation experiments. The parameters for the simulation experiments can be modified in the "if name == 'main':" module within the program. Each simulation with different parameters runs 100 times, and the program returns the sigma (which depends on the FAP distribution), the number of bursts, and the misjudged periods for each PBA search under the different parameters.

The third file, "Period search for FRB 20190520.py," is the period search for FRB 20190520B. This program relies on the FAP distribution of the observation window for FRB 20190520B and the data file for FRB 20190520B (the file has been organized in an Excel sheet, which includes different sheets; the period search mainly uses the "remove 58" sheet). When calculating different energy bands, the FAP distribution for each energy band's observation window must also be computed. The results return the sigma for each period search, the phase of each burst, and the observation phase for each iteration (for plotting).
